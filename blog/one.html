        <i>Code in C-Sharp</i><br><br>
        <p class="blog">For this blog post, I just want to vent about how bloated and how much I hate C-Sharp. So yesterday, I was asked to write
            a script that prints out C#. Easy, right? No. No it is not. First, I had to install .NET 8.5 which took forever on that
            because the download is hidden. Then after this, it didn't even work, and I had to install .NET AGAIN. Then, I had to run
            an abtriuary command that is not in the help, and then it worked. But worse, is C. I spent <strong>20 MINUTES</strong> LOOKING AND TRIED 
            LIKE <strong>20</strong> DIFFERENT COMPILERS. ON LINUX, ITS AN EASY COMMAND, BUT HERE I HAD NO EASY COMMAND AND HAD TO
            ADD IT TO THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
            <br><br><br><br></p>

            <p>Anyways, thats it for today.</p>
